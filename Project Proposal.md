## Description and Motivation
Greg and myself want to create a whack a mole clone, but with a few twists. In short we would like to add audio to the characters whenever they would get hit and some characters would provide more points then others, some would remove points, and we are also going to add a wild card.

## Prior Art
Our page we are trying to build will be a representation of the classic whack a mole with a few twists.

## Core User Workflows
The core user workflows that our project should have include would be the basic setup of the normal whack a mole, but with characters providing different points, interaction noises, a players score, and be able to provide a retry once the game has finished.

## Week 1 Tuesday-Friday Daily Goals
#### Tuesday: HTML/CSS page set up with proper images.
Greg will work on the HTML side and Joseph will work on the CSS side of the page.

#### Wednesday: Set up as much of animation/audio for characters as possible for that day.
Greg will work on the audio side of the page and Joseph will work on getting the animations for the characters to work properly.

#### Thursday: Set up point system with interactions and make sure interaction audio works as well as when the music ends the game ends.
Greg and Joseph will have to work together that day to get the point system to work with the interactions and their audio and when the music ends the game ends.

#### Friday: Bug testing and finishing up on features.
Greg and Joseph will work on finishing up any unfinished features and work on bug testing as well as README.md.
