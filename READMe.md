There are no major requirements for the technologies listed above other then some pip installations and links.

## To do:
- Add better randomization to whack a mole characters
- Add high score feature

## Project Status
The projects current status is still a very early and unfinished game, but the main mechanics we wanted are there.



## Inspiration
We didn't really have that big of an inspiration when thinking about it, but we were inspired to just add a fun twist to a classic game. The main difference we wanted
was a lot more audio interaction with fun pictures to go along for the experience.
